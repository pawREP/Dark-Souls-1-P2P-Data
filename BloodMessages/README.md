# Blood Messages

The json file contains 53305 Orange Soapstone Messages by 35127 users. They were all collected between 2018-03-05 and 2018-03-08 from public network traffic generated by the game clients. The messages are unfiltered and some might contain illegitimate data.

##### Some comments about the fields:

* "Owner":  Contains the SteamID64 of the user that placed the message. Messages that were placed before the switch to steam contain the player's user name.
* "UnixTime"/"TimeString" : For the steam version, this contains a timestamp that is generated when the first packet that contains a timestamp is build. It will stay static until the game is restarted. A few packets contain the timestamp 2000-01-01 00:00:00 which is the lowest datetime representable in the internal time format. It's generated when GetServerRealTime() fails. The behaviour of the GFWL client is unknown.
